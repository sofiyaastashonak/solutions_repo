# Problem 1
# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection


## **1. Introduction**
Have you ever wondered how a soccer ball follows a curved path when kicked? Or how rockets and missiles follow precise trajectories? This is all because of **projectile motion**!  

In this report, i will **explore how the range of a projectile depends on the launch angle** and break it down step by step.

## **2. What is Projectile Motion?**
Projectile motion happens when an object is launched into the air and moves under the influence of **gravity**. The motion can be split into two parts:

- **Horizontal motion**: The object moves forward with a constant speed.

- **Vertical motion**: The object moves up and down due to gravity.

To understand projectile motion better, let's derive some important equations.

## **3. Key Equations of Motion** 

### **3.1 Breaking Motion into Components**
If an object is launched with an **initial speed** $v_0$ at an **angle** $\theta$, we can break this velocity into:

- **Horizontal velocity**: $v_x=v_0\cos\theta$

- **Vertical velocity**: $v_y=v_0\sin\theta$

Since gravity **only affects vertical motion**, the horizontal velocity **stays constant**.

---

### **3.2 Equations for Position and Velocity**
Using basic physics formulas, we get:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Horizontal position (distance traveled in time $t$)**:

$$x=v_0\cos\theta\cdot t$$

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Vertical position (height at time $t$)**: 

$$y=v_0\sin\theta\cdot t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Velocity in the horizontal direction** (always constant):  

$$v_x=v_0\cos\theta$$

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Velocity in the vertical direction** (changes due to gravity): 

$$v_y=v_0\sin\theta-gt$$

### **3.3 Finding Special Points**
Now let's look at some important moments in the projectile‚Äôs motion.

‚úîÔ∏è **Time of Flight** (How long the object stays in the air): 

$$t_f=\frac{2v_0\sin\theta}{g}$$  

‚úîÔ∏è **Maximum Height** (The highest point the object reaches): 

$$H=\frac{(v_0\sin\theta)^2}{2g}$$  

‚úîÔ∏è **Range (Total Distance the Object Travels Before Hitting the Ground)**:

$$R=\frac{v_0^2\sin(2\theta)}{g}$$  

 **Interesting Fact:** The projectile travels the **longest distance** when launched at **45¬∞** because $\sin(2\theta)$ is **largest at this angle**.

## **4. Family of Solutions**
The equations above describe a **family of solutions** depending on different values of:

1. **Launch speed ($v_0$)**: Faster projectiles travel farther and higher.

2. **Launch angle ($\theta$)**: Determines the shape of the trajectory.

3. **Gravity ($g$)**: Affects how quickly the projectile falls.

4. **Initial height ($h$)**: Changes the total flight time and range.

By adjusting these values, we get **different possible trajectories**, from low and fast motions (like bullets) to high and slow ones (like thrown balls).

## **5. Limitations of the Idealized Model**
The equations we used assume an **ideal world** where:

‚ùå **No air resistance**: In reality, air slows down projectiles.  
‚ùå **Flat ground assumption**: The model assumes the projectile lands at the same height.  
‚ùå **Constant gravity ($g$)**: Gravity actually changes with altitude.  

Because of these assumptions, our equations give **approximate results** in the real world.

## **6. Extending the Model: Real-World Effects**
To make the model more **realistic**, we can add:

‚úÖ **Air Resistance (Drag Force)**  

   - The force slows the projectile down.  
   - The drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity:  

     $$F_d=\frac{1}{2} C_d \rho A v^2$$  

     where $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho$ is air density, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area.  

‚úÖ **Wind Effects**  

   - A tailwind increases range, while a headwind decreases it.  

‚úÖ **Launch Altitude**  

   - At high altitudes, air resistance is lower, and gravity is weaker, so objects travel **farther**.  

‚úÖ **Rotation of the Earth (Coriolis Effect)** 

   - Important for long-range artillery and missiles.

## **7. Real-World Applications üåç**
Projectile motion is not just for physics classes! It applies to:

- **Sports**: How football players kick the ball at different angles.

- **Military**: How missiles and bullets are fired for maximum range.

- **Space Exploration**: How rockets are launched at precise angles.

## **8. Conclusion**
Now we u understand the key ideas behind projectile motion:

- **It has both horizontal and vertical movement**.

- **Gravity only affects the vertical motion**.

- **The best angle for the longest range is 45¬∞**.

- **The initial speed, angle, and gravity all affect the motion**.

- **The real world includes air resistance, wind, and altitude effects**.

Understanding these principles helps in designing better sports strategies, video game physics, and even launching space missions!
