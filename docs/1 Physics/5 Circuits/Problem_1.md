## Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory  

---

## âœ… 1. Motivation  

Calculating equivalent resistance is a key task in circuit analysis. Traditionally, this involves applying **series and parallel rules**, but for **complex resistor networks**, these manual methods become inefficient and error-prone.

Graph theory provides a powerful alternative. By modeling the circuit as a **weighted graph**:

- Nodes represent junctions,
- Edges represent resistors (weights = resistance),
- The task becomes a problem of graph simplification.

This method allows for **algorithmic**, repeatable, and programmable solutions â€” which are especially useful in circuit simulation software.

---

## âœ… 2. Problem Setup  

We consider a circuit modeled as a graph with:

- Nodes representing **junctions**,
- Edges representing **resistors** (with resistance values as weights),
- One **START** node and one **END** node.

The goal is to find the **equivalent resistance** between START and END by simplifying the graph using algorithmic steps based on electrical principles.

## âœ… 3. Theoretical Concepts  

### ðŸ”¹ Ohmâ€™s Law  
$$V = IR$$

### ðŸ”¹ Series Resistance  
If resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in **series**: 

$$R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2$$

### ðŸ”¹ Parallel Resistance  
If resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in **parallel**: 

$$\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$$

---

## âœ… 4. Graph-Based Strategy  

We represent the circuit as a **graph**:
- Vertices = junctions
- Edges = resistors with weights
- Start and end nodes are marked

The simplification proceeds by:
- Identifying nodes with **degree = 2** (series),
- Identifying **multiple edges** between the same nodes (parallel),
- Iteratively applying reduction rules until a single edge remains.

## âœ… 5. Algorithm Overview  

**Step-by-step simplification algorithm:**

1. Find nodes with degree 2 (excluding START and END).
2. Apply **series rule** to combine two adjacent resistors.
3. Find **multiple edges** between two nodes.
4. Apply **parallel rule** to combine them.
5. Repeat steps until only one edge connects START to END.

### âœ… Step 1: Initial Circuit

- STARTâ€“A: 2 Î©  
- Aâ€“B: 3 Î©

### âœ… Step 2: Combine Bâ€“Câ€“END and Bâ€“END in Parallel

- Bâ€“C = 4 Î©, Câ€“END = 5 Î© â†’ total series: 4 + 5 = **9 Î©**
- Bâ€“END = 8 Î©

Combine in parallel:

$$
R_{B-END} = \left(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{9}\right)^{-1} = \frac{72}{17} â‰ˆ 4.24\ \Omega
$$

### âœ… Step 3: Combine Aâ€“Bâ€“END as Series

- Aâ€“B = 3 Î©  
- Bâ€“END (parallel result) = 4.24 Î©  

Combined:

$$
R_{Aâ€“END}^{(1)} = 3 + 4.24 = 7.24\ \Omega
$$

- Aâ€“C = 6 Î©  
- Câ€“END = 5 Î© â†’ Aâ€“Câ€“END = 11 Î©

### âœ… Step 4: Final Parallel Between Aâ€“Bâ€“END and Aâ€“Câ€“END

Parallel of 7.24 Î© and 11 Î©:

$$
R_{\text{Aâ€“END}} = \left(\frac{1}{7.24} + \frac{1}{11}\right)^{-1} = \frac{79.64}{18.24} â‰ˆ 4.37\ \Omega
$$

### âœ… Final Equivalent Resistance from START

$$
R_{\text{eq}} = R_{\text{STARTâ€“A}} + R_{\text{Aâ€“END}} = 2 + 4.37 = \boxed{6.37\ \Omega}
$$
